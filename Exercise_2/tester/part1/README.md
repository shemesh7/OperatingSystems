## Tester for Part 1

⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- This tester is **for your own use** and is **not guaranteed** to be the one used by the grader.
- The provided tester **only covers Part 1** of the assignment.
- I could have just given u the executable but I decided not to so u could change the tester and maybe add more tests (and if u do so please share it with your classmates).

### How to Use the Tester

0. **Setup:**  
   Clone the git repo, make sure that the tester (and the executables I gave) are in the same directory with your files.  
1. **Compile Your Program:**
   ```bash
   gcc -o tournament tournament.c
   gcc -o gladiator gladiator.c
   ```
2. **Compile the Tester:**
   ```bash
   gcc -o tester tester.c
   ```
3. **Run the Tester:**
   ```bash
   ./tester
   ```

### Customizing the Tester
- If you want to **add more test cases**, modify `tester.c` and include additional scenarios.
- Feel free to **change file contents** and **experiment** with different cases.

💡 **This tester is meant to assist you, but ultimately, it's your responsibility to ensure your implementation meets all requirements.**
